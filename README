BasicSPH

1. Description
--------------
This project contains a basic SPH fluid simulator written with ease of
understanding in mind. Simplicity and clearness of the code has been favored
over speed and flexibility in order to make it a good starting point for someone
 who wants to learn the basics of an SPH fluid simulator.

The implementation is based on the papers "Weakly compressible SPH for free
surface flows" (Becker and Teschner 2007) and "Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics"
(Monaghan 1992). 

2. Build project
----------------
To build the project, either use CMake to generate the project files or create
a new project from scratch (using your favorite IDE) and include all the source
files.

3. Running the simulation
-------------------------
The generated executable takes an output directory as its only argument. For 
example, the following command will run the simulation and output its result in
the  "TestOutput" directory:

$ ./BasicSPH TestOutput

The particles are outputed in the .geo format that can be read using the
Houdini Software (a free version is available at http://sidefx.com). There is
no other format supported for now.
